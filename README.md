A (new) color scheme based on the [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com) TextMate theme 
with support to GUI (24 bit) colors.


## Installation

Install [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then add a 
git submodule for your plugin:

```

### Vundle

Install [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) and then add this theme
as a plugin to your `.vimrc`.

```

Copy `new-railscasts.vim` into `~/.vim/colors/` (Unix) or 
`vimfiles/colors/` (Windows).

and set your Colorscheme:
